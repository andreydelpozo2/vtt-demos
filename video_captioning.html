<p>The biggest frustration I had the last time I worked with HTML5 video was its lack of support for captions and subtitle tracks. The support is still not uniform but at least we can now be better assured that the video will have some sort of caption. </p>
<h2>Introducing VTT</h2>
<p>WebVTT (Web Video Time Tracks), formerly known as WebSRT, is a W3C community proposal for synchronized video caption playback. It is a time-indexed file format and it is referenced by HTML5 video <strong>and</strong> audio elements.</p>
<p>As with many assistive technologies, it would be a mistake to assume that they are only meant as a way to provide for accessibility accomodations. We can enable captions when the ambient noise is too loud to listen to a recorded presentation, we can use chapters to navigate through a long lecture video just like DVD or Blue Ray movies.</p>
<p>Captions can also improve our movies' discoverability. Google indexes the content of our captions. Both YouTube and Google search can report results based on the video captions available for a given file. </p>
<p>WebVTT files provide open captions, independent of the audio or video files they are attached to, they are not "hard coded" into pixels. This also means that creating VTT files requires nothing more than a text editor; although there are more specialized tools to create the captions. </p>
<h2>Browser support</h2>
<p>Based on Silvia Pfeiffer's <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/texttracks/2012/08/23/webvtt-support-in-browsers/">post to the VTT community group</a> dated August, 2012, and updated with new information about Firefox, the following browsers support VTT tracks for video and audio:</p>

<h2>Polyfills and alternatives</h2>
<p>I will use one of the many polyfils available for HTML5 Video Tracks. <a href="http://www.delphiki.com/html5/playr/">Playr</a> seems to be the most feature complete polyfill for HTML5 video tracks. The downside is 2 more files (one CSS and one JavaScript) to download for the video page but until VTT is widely supported the extra files are worth the effort to create accessible content. </p>
<p>One way to ensure that we only load our polyfill if the browser doesn't support tracks natively is to use Modernizr.load to conditionally load Playr's CSS and JavaScript when the browser does not support HTML5 video tag natively. </p>
<pre><code>Modernizr.load([
 {
    // test whether we support video
    test : Modernizr.video,
    // Load the corresponding assetts for the polyfill you want to use
    // in this case we are using the playr polyfill
    nope : ['playr.js', 'playr.css']
  },
])</code></pre>

<p>The code below uses plain JavaScript to test if a browser supports  HTML5 video by creating an empty video element and testing for the video's canPlayType property. It will not load the code for a polyfill like the Modernizr example.</p>
<pre><code>var canPlay = false;
  // Create an empty video element
  var v = document.createElement('video');
  // If the video can playType and can play MP4 video
  if(v.canPlayType) {
    // Set canPlay to true
    canPlay = true;
    // Display an alert telling them so
    alert('Can Play HTML5 video')
  }
  else {
    // Display an alert or do something else to accomodate
    // to the user
    alert('Your browser does not support HTML5 video')
  }
</code></pre>

<p>This is the simplest test for video support; a more elaborate version can include support for specific formats and write the <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> tags only for the supported formats. The example below makes the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have encoded a video in all three formats (webm, mp4 and ogg)</li>
<li>You are testing for support for HTML5 video in general and specific formats</li>
<li>If HTML5 video is not supported you have a flash-based fallback solution</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>var canPlay = false;
  // Get the video by selecting the video tag
  var v = document.getElementsByTagName('video');
  // Optionally add video attribtues as needed
  // At a minimum set height, width and controls
  // as shown below
  v.setAttribute('height', '640');
  v.setAttribute('width', '480');
  v.setAttribute('control', 'control');

  // If the video can playType and can play MP4 video
  if (v.canPlayType &amp;&amp; v.canPlayType('video/webm'; codecs="vp8, vorbis"').replace(/no/, '')){
    // append the appropriate source track
    var webm = v.appendChild(source);
    webm.setAttribute("source", "myvideo.webm");
    webm.setAttribute("type", "video/webm");
  }
  else if (v.canPlayType &amp;&amp; v.canPlayType('video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"').replace(/no/, '')){
    // append the appropriate source track
    var mp4 = v.appendChild(source);
    mp4.setAttribute("source", "myvideo.mp4");
    mp4.setAttribute("type", "'video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"'");    
  }
  else if {
    (v.canPlayType &amp;&amp; v.canPlayType('video/ogg; codecs="theora"').replace(/no/, '')){
    var ogg = v.appendChild(source);
    ogg.setAttribute("source", "myvideo.mp4");
    ogg.setAttribute("type", "video/ogg");
  } 
  else {
    // Provide a flash-based fallback
  }

</code></pre>

<p>Also note that we're testing for specific audio and video codec combinations. WebM and Ogg support a single combination of video and audio codecs but MP4 supports multiple profiles, not all of which are supported in HTML5 video. See <a href="http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/faq/what-are-different-profiles-supported-mpeg-4-video">this article</a> for an introduction to the different profiles supported by MPEG4. </p>
<h3>Players and Polyfills</h3>

<h2>Accessibility and ARIA considerations</h2>
<p><strong>To be written once I get more feedback from appropriate parties</strong></p>
<h2>Different types of VTT tracks and their structures</h2>
<h3>Captioning Tracks</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Captioning is text that appears on a video, which contains dialogue and audio cues such as music or sound effects that occur off-screen. The purpose of captioning is to make video content accessible to those who are deaf or hard of hearing, and for other situations in which the audio cannot be heard due to noise or a need for silence.</p>
<p>Captions can be either open (always visible, aka "burned in") or closed, but closed is more common because it lets each viewer decide whether they want the captions to be turned on or off. </p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.cpcweb.com/faq/">http://www.cpcweb.com/faq/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The simplest and most often used type of text track, captions provide alternative text content for people with visual dissabilities, for people who choose to play the video without audio, and others.</p>
<p>Depending on the player you may have open captions, where the captions are always visible on screen,  or closed captions where you have to manually activate the display of captions; Either open or closed, the captions are independent of the content they are attached to. </p>

<h3>Optional Cue Settings</h3>
<p>Cues can also be styled and moved around the screen relative to the borders of the video. The table below summarizes the settings avalable for cues. </p>

<p class="note">Note: if no cue settings are set, the positioning default to the middle, at the bottom of the frame.</p>

<h4>Speaker Semantics</h4>
<p>You can use a combination of cue positioning and specific markup on individual cues to further emphazise who is speaking in a given caption or subtitle where appropriate. </p>

<h3>Subtitles Tracks</h3>
<p>Subtitle Tracks are similar to Caption Tracks but are not meant to address accessibility issues as Captions are. Subtitle tracks are used primarily to convey the dialogue in a language other than the one being spoken in the video. Take, for example a Japanese movie where the subtitles translate the content to English. </p>
<p>Subtitles are not expected to convey additional non-verbal cues. Once again, are only meant to provide a translation of the content being played although some delivery formats such as Blue Ray do not follow this recommendation. </p>
<p><strong>What's the difference between captions and subtitles?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main difference is that subtitles usually only transcribe the spoken dialog, and are mainly aimed at people who are not hearing impaired, but lack fluency in the spoken language. Closed captions are aimed at the deaf and hearing impaired, who need additional non-verbal audio cues (such as "[GUN SHOT]" or "[SPOOKY MUSIC]") to be transcribed in the text. Closed captions are also useful for situations in which video is being shown but the sound is muted or difficult to hear, such as for a noisy bar, convention floor, video signage &amp; billboards, etc.</p>
<p>Subtitles which also contain these non-verbal cues are usually referred to as "SDH" (Subtitles for the Deaf and Hard of hearing) tracks, but for various reasons, closed captions are usually the preferred method of making video accessible for the deaf and hearing impaired. SDH subtitles tend to be used on video formats that do not support closed captioning, such as Blu-ray discs.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.cpcweb.com/faq/">http://www.cpcweb.com/faq/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as HTML5 video is concerned the only difference between captions and subtitles are the way the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tags are structured:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- This is the captions track --&gt;
&lt;track kind="captions" lang="en" srclang="en" label="English" src="sintel.vtt" /&gt;
&lt;!-- This is the subtitles track,  for Spanish --&gt;
&lt;track kind="subtitles" lang="es" srclang="es" label="Espa&ntilde;" src="sintel-es.vtt" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Chapter Tracks</h3>
<p>Chapter tracks help you navigate through the video by associating certain "chapters" with time codes. This will let you navigate to different sections of your video using some sort of visual cue.</p>
<p>In the example below, chapter 1 is 10 second long and titled Introduction to HTML5. </p>
<pre><code>WEBVTT (1)

Chapter 1 (2)
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:10.000 (3)
Introduction to HTML5(4)

Chapter 2
00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:15.000
Introduction to HTML5</code></pre>

<p><strong>Explanation of the chapter above:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>WEBVTT must be the first item on the file, on the first line and in a line of its own. It must be followed by a blank line</li>
<li>The name of the chapter </li>
<li>Immediately below the name of the chapter come the beginning and end time expressed in hours:minutes:seconds:milliseconds format. <strong>Hours, Minutes and Seconds must have 2 digits and be padded with zeros if necessary. Miliseconds must have 3 digits and be zero padded if not long enough</strong></li>
<li>The title of the chapter</li>
</ol>
<h3>Description Tracks</h3>
<h3>Metadata Tracks</h3>
<p><strong> Getting more information about Metadata tracks to make sure I'm accurate </strong></p>
<p>According to the VTT specification (<a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/webvtt/#dfn-webvtt-metadata-text">http://dev.w3.org/html5/webvtt/#dfn-webvtt-metadata-text</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WebVTT metadata text consists of any sequence of zero or more characters other than U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters and U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters, each optionally separated from the next by a WebVTT line terminator. (In other words, any text that does not have two consecutive WebVTT line terminators and does not start or end with a WebVTT line terminator.)</p>
<p>WebVTT metadata text cues are only useful for scripted applications (using the metadata text track kind).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Building the tracks</h2>
<p>We can build our caption file using the text above as an example, and this is the most common way to caption a video for accessibility.</p>
<p>We can also build multiple caption tracks as well as a variety of other tracks. Most polyfills will support a subset of the full VTT specification, Playr, the polyfill I've selected for these examples, supports both captions and chapter tracks. </p>
<h3>Inline Styles and Voices</h3>
<h2>Getting the captions to work</h2>
<h3>Building the tracks</h3>
<p>(built with information from <a href="http://demosthenes.info/blog/584/Creating-And-Validating-WebVTT-Subtitles">http://demosthenes.info/blog/584/Creating-And-Validating-WebVTT-Subtitles</a>)</p>
<p>There are no programs that natively support VTT as a captioning program. However there are plenty of programs that will create SRT captions, which is very similar to VTT (we'll discuss the differences later in this section). </p>
<p>Choose whatever tool will work best for you to generate the SRT file; then follow the instructions below to convert them to VTT files. </p>
<h4>Converting SRT to VTT</h4>
<p>Due to their close relationship, conversion from .srt into .vtt is very simple. A typical .srt file will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>1
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,675
Life on the road is something
I was raised to embrace.</code></pre>

<p>The process is little more than a find-and-replace:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add WEBVTT to the first line of the file</li>
<li>Replace them with Cue - prefixes.</li>
<li>Convert the comma before the millisecond mark in every timestamp to a decimal point.</li>
<li>Add styling markup to the subtitle text.</li>
</ul>
<p>The resulting VTT file will look like this: </p>
<pre><code>WEBVTT

Life
01:21.700 --> 01:24.675
Life on the road is something
I was <i>raised</i> to embrace.</code></pre>

<p>Save the file with a .vtt extension and link to it from a <code>&lt;track&gt;</code> element in your video tag as explained below.</p>
<h4>Validating A VTT File</h4>
<p>*<em> More to be written once I get to play with http://quuz.org/webvtt/ some more</em></p>
<h3>Adding the tracks to the video</h3>
<p>Either in a supported browser or using one of the polyfills available (like we've chosen to do with Playr) we add <code>&lt;track&gt;</code> elements, one for each language of captions that we make available. </p>
<p>There is one non-standard attribute we will add to the video to  make it work with Playr. The code below shows what a video track looks with associated an associated caption track for English.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>One final note is that you can have multiple tracks supporting multiple languages and different purposes (captions, subtitles and chapters) but not all track types are supported by all polyfills. </p>
